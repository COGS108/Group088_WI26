    "What factors can best predict the success of live-service shooters on Steam? Specifically, using pre-launch data (search interest, online activity, and developer/publisher) and early post-launch data (initial price and peak concurrent users), can we determine the factors that most accurately forecast long-term profitability (estimated revenue through review numbers), player retention (average playtime in the last two weeks), and community reception (final positive review percentage)?"

    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Steam, one of the most prominent online gaming platforms with millions of daily players, is home to thousands of shooting games. With the intense competition between video games of the same genre, each game must be able to portray and sell their uniqueness to emerge victorious in the rivalry between industries. A game can achieve this through creating outstanding graphical animations, developing special gameplay mechanics, reducing monetary costs, sharing connections to popular series or creators, and marketing to spread awareness. However, if a game fails to do so, it may not meet the expectations of the player community, resulting in what’s known as a flop (collectively acknowledged failures). Therefore, how do the developers and publishers of live-service shooting games anticipate a game’s commercial success of revenue and critical success of player reviews and engagement shortly after launch, or even before release, to prevent flops that can result in financial and occupational risks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, factors like price can greatly influence consumer behavior as there are over 1800 free to play shooter games on Steam, with Counter-Strike 2 and PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS being the most widely known. Yet, even with more expensive price tags, games like Arc Raiders (launched at 40 USD) and Red Dead Redemption 2 (launched at 60 USD) still received great feedback in response to positive early reviews. To fully grasp the correlation between certain factors and a game’s success, our team will analyze the results of pre-launch data and early post-launch data to determine how to best achieve success. We were motivated in this research due to our familiarity in playing video games, especially those that include shooting aspects. Despite playing in the same category of video games, we each have our own personal favorites when it comes down to shooting games. Consequently, we noticed that although every game provides a different experience, we all seem to enjoy those different aspects of the game. Therefore, we are curious to see the impacts on success of the various characteristics a game features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prior Work\n",
    "Similar questions have been asked by several researchers in the past, for instance, by researcher and data scientist <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355110719_Predicting_the_Popularity_of_Games_on_Steam\">David Nabergoj</a>. David and his team sought out to predict the popularity of games on Steam. To elaborate, the study attempted to discover the relationship between the popularity of the game and its features. Using Bayesian models, the game's popularity was measured before and after its release, which was contingent on its price, storage size, supported languages, release date, and genre. Their findings concluded that a genre-based hierarchical model performed the best, as well as certain genres and early release dates were strongly associated with higher player counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset their model operated on consisted of games released after 2015. Gathered from three disparate sources, Steam API, Stream Spy, which offers data not available from Steam's API, and Steam DB, a historical database of player count. Price, and system requirements were the primary aim of their data wrangling procedure. Cheaper games are, generally, more popular, and the more storage a game requires, the greater the budget, inferring the higher the reputation of the game . Upon cleaning their data they were left with a dataset upwards of 8,000 games.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction aimed to correctly analyze the median player count by the second month upon the game's release. By utilizing simple regression models it was found that, not only were most games cheap and minimal in storage size, but overwhelmed by outliers as well. Certain categories such as developers and publishers were dropped from categorical features as there were too many confounding variables. The player counts peaked the first month after release, and numbers plateaued the second. Therefore, it can be said that the first month is paramount in predicting success. Marginal factors included supported languages, storage size, price, and the time at which the game was released.\n",

    "- 1. Revenue: We predict that pre-launch search interest will be the strongest predictor of estimated revenue. However, for free-to-play games, peak concurrent users will more accurately forecast revenue in the long term. This is because live-service games rely on recurring transactions for sustained revenue, and rely on a high volume of players.\n",
    "- 2. Retention: We predict that revenue will be strongly correlated with a game's initial price and less so with search interest. This is because the hype around a game spikes and dies down gradually over time (exponential decay), and financial investment will drive players to play a game for longer.\n",
    "- 3. Reception: We predict that an interaction between initial price and category count (number of features like Steam Achievements or Cloud Save) will correlate with the final positive review percentage. This is because games with a high price point yet low number of features will be perceived to be \"lacking polish\", and receive more negative reviews.\n",

    "### Data overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dataset #1\n",
    "  - Dataset Name: Steam Web API (general metadata about game)\n",
    "  - Link to the dataset: https://steamcommunity.com/dev\n",
    "  - Number of observations: ~180,000\n",
    "  - Number of variables: 36\n",
    "  - Most relevant are: supported_languages, pc_requirements, platforms, genres, categories\n",
    "    - supported_langauges is stored in a string format containing the language name and some other texts. The other variables (pc_requirements, platforms, genres, and categories) are stored in a list of dictionaries that contain information about each category. These are important features as they provide the general information regarding the metadata of the games. For instance, we can compared how the various language supported or diffferent pc requirements can affect how players view the game, thus allowing us to see if which aspect of the game can boost its success.\n",
    "  - Shortcomings: Requires a steam account which has spent over $5 in steam so data may not be overly representative. Also rate limits to 1.5s interval requests, making data processing and gathering tedious.\n",
    "- Datset #2\n",
    "  - Dataset Name: Google Trends (google searches of the game)\n",
    "  - Link to the dataset: https://trends.google.com/trends\n",
    "  - Number of observations: ~1 billion\n",
    "  - Number of variables: 1\n",
    "  - Most relevant are: search_interest\n",
    "    - Search interest is a relative, normalized metric (0–100) representing a topic's popularity compared to total search volume, not absolute search numbers. A score of 100 indicates peak popularity, 50 means half as popular, and 0 means insufficient data. This is a normalized value, making the comparison between different time periods possible. With this, we can filter the timeframe for pre-launch data that can imply the amount of followers and attentions the game has, providing a metric to how popular a game is.\n",
    "  - Shortcomings: Only has one variable: search_interest. Requests also take a while because Google has undisclosed rate limits, slowing down the processing of data. Therefore, we need to randomly sample a small amount of games from our SteamSpy dataset so that we can reduce the runtime and have a cleaner dataset.\n",
    "- Dataset #3\n",
    "  - Dataset Name: SteamSpy (overview statistics of game)\n",
    "  - Link to the dataset: https://steamspy.com/api.php\n",
    "  - Number of observations: ~65,000\n",
    "  - Number of variables: 20\n",
    "  - Most relevant are: initialprice, owners, ccu, developer, publisher, positive, negative\n",
    "      - These are important features as they can be utilized as metrics for our game success indicator. The variable owners depict the range of individuals who own the game in string format, while ccu represents the peak concurrent users in integer format that signifies the maximum total number of players logged in the game during a single time frame. Combining with the variable initialprice (original US price in cents), we can calulate the estimated revenue in sales based on how many people bought the game. Prices of games can vary drastically, from less than $10 USD to more than $50 depending on the types of games. Besides this, the metadata of the game, such as its developer (string), publisher (string), and the number of positive and negative reviews (interger counts) it received, can also help determine the public recognition and connotation toward the game.\n",
    "  - Shortcomings: Less accurate because it relies on people setting their profiles to public, since they're private by default. They scrape information from profiles, but with a fraction of the total data, they rely on a lot of statistical inference which can have errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To combine these datasets, we start with #2. That one has only one variable so we simply add it as a column to #1. To merge the new #1 and #3, we will use descriptive data from the official API and merge it with variables like positive, negative, and ccu from SteamSpy—these variables don't exist in the official API."

    "1. Change the header from Dataset #1 to something more descriptive of the dataset\n",
    "2. Write a few paragraphs about this dataset. Make sure to cover\n",
    "   1. Describe the important metrics, what units they are in, and giv some sense of what they mean.  For example \"Fasting blood glucose in units of mg glucose per deciliter of blood.  Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",

    "    1. load the dataset \n",

    "\n",
    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> All user data originates from the Steam API, where users agree to data usage through Steam’s Privacy Policy and EULA before creating accounts. We only access publicly available information permitted under these agreements and do not collect private or restricted user data.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We recognize that Steam users, FPS players specifically, may not represent the broader gaming population. FPS communities tend to skew toward certain demographics like gender and age, which may bias measures of “success.” We account for this by interpreting findings as specific to the Steam FPS ecosystem rather than generalizing to all gamers. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Usernames may appear in raw datasets as identifiers but are only used internally for deduplication and record matching. All personally identifiable information is removed or anonymized prior to analysis and reporting to prevent traceability to individuals. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "> Because demographic attributes such as race or gender are not available in the dataset, we acknowledge that we cannot directly test for group-level disparities. We therefore avoid making claims about demographic fairness and limit conclusions strictly to observable behavioral metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> All datasets are stored on secured, access-controlled systems. Only project members have access, and files are shared through encrypted platforms to minimize risk of unauthorized exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Since we use publicly available data and anonymize it before analysis, individuals are not directly identifiable. If requested, any raw records associated with a user can be removed from local copies of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Data will be retained only for the duration of the project. Unnecessary or intermediate files will be deleted, and all raw data will be securely removed after analysis is complete. \n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We discuss assumptions within the team and consider how different stakeholders (developers, players, underrepresented groups) might interpret the results to reduce blind spots in our conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    ">We examine the dataset for potential sources of bias such as overrepresentation of highly popular games, underrepresentation of niche titles, missing values, and class imbalance. Because Steam users and FPS players may not reflect the broader gaming population, we interpret results within this context and avoid generalizing beyond the platform. Where appropriate, we use normalization or stratified analysis to reduce skewed outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Visualizations and summaries are designed to avoid misleading scales. We report uncertainty and limitations alongside results.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Personally identifiable information, including usernames, is used only temporarily for internal data cleaning and record matching. All identifying information is removed or anonymized before analysis and is never included in visualizations, reports, or shared outputs. Results are presented only in aggregated form to protect individual privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Data used from Steam users will be identified as their public usernames, but that information will not be publicly shared in our data. Usernames are used as a unique identifier, as we go through all the datasets, but are completely irrelevant and will not be presented in our findings. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "> All preprocessing and modeling steps are documented and reproducible through code and version control to allow future review or correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    ">We avoid using features that may indirectly encode sensitive attributes. Only gameplay and performance-related metrics are included.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Although demographic labels are unavailable, we test model performance across different game sizes and popularity levels to ensure predictions are not disproportionately skewed toward certain subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    ">We evaluate multiple performance metrics rather than optimizing for a single score to avoid misleading conclusions. For example, we consider accuracy alongside precision/recall or error-based measures to ensure the model performs consistently across different scenarios and does not favor one type of outcome at the expense of others.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "\n",
    ">We prioritize interpretable modeling approaches and provide clear explanations of how predictions are generated. Feature importance and model behavior are documented so stakeholders can understand which factors influence outcomes and can question or validate decisions when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    ">We explicitly communicate that predictions are correlational, depend on historical Steam data, and may not generalize to other platforms or future trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "\n",
    ">If deployed, the model’s performance would be monitored regularly to detect performance degradation, bias, or changes in data patterns over time like new gaming trends or shifts in player behavior. Periodic evaluations and retraining would be conducted to ensure the model remains accurate, fair, and aligned with its intended purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> If harm or misuse is identified, we will investigate, adjust the model, or remove problematic features.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Deployment would allow the model to be disabled or reverted to previous versions if issues arise.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    ">We caution that predictions should inform analysis rather than replace human judgment, reducing the risk of misuse in decision-making.\n"
